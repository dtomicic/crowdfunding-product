## Project task
Task was to build the crowdfunding page for a project where users can bookmark the project, donate to it and get confirmation when they make a donation.

## Project overview
Doing the overall design was quite easy, had a bit of a problem with positioning the modals but managed to solve it with usage of different position styles. That was the only thing a bit challenging about the design. Next part was doing the functionality (JavaScript) per task user should be able to back the project by clicking the button, bookmark the project, select the reward from a default reward menu, also the user should get a confirmation modal when the donation goes through and also he should see the number of money acquired by the project (the number should be getting bigger after a user donation) also the number of backers should be getting bigger by one and the slider should increase when user donates. All of this went quite easily except for the part of donating when user inputs his donation first time it adds up correctly and number of backers goes up by one but if the user immediately donates again the numbers gets a lot bigger. Couldn't find a solution for it so I left it like that but I'll play around some more and try to solve it.
